# The weather API

This test is designed to allow you to showcase your development skills and creativity, utilising your preferred JavaScript framework.

This test requires that you make calls to a weather service API and create a component UI based around the resulting data.

Specifically, we would like you to create  a simple interface that displays the current weather in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. Only one city should be displayed at a time, with a tabbed navigation allowing for switching between cities. Beyond this, it is up to you which information you surface and how it is presented.

The link to the API documentation is https://developer.weatherunlocked.com/documentation/localweather

We have already created an account for this test.
